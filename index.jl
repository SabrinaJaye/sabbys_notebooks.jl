# Sabby's Pluto Notebooks

Welcome! You've found the draw in which I keep all my Pluto.jl notebooks.
Think code notebooks like Jupyter, but specific to the Julia language, with live updating cells, interactive elements, and notebook specific package environments.

Anyway, take a look around.
Whenever I do any quick and dirty, or exploratory analyses I typically put it into one of these notebooks. But they're also great for writing nice, complete, interactive lessons or home-works.
